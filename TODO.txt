Remove binaries from src folder

Optimization:
Used stl functionality in TypingStats
Elaborate on the overhead arrays in TypingStats: Those which only hold information that could fully be derived from the top 3 arrays in the class.
    However, we still decide to use those to accelerate compution. Similarly, we also export them into the JSON to be less error prone in 
    the code and because hard disk drive is neither limited nor has any cost of use.
